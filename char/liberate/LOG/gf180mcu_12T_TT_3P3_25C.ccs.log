.WARNING (LIB-10031): Cannot determine the maximum load for gf180mcu_osu_sc_12T_mux2_1:Y. The value (1e-08) currently set with parameter 'max_transition' is too small. Specify a larger value for this parameter and rerun the Tcl script.
WARNING (LIB-411): An estimated max load value of 2.40388e-13F will be used for slew: '1.03298e-08s' pin: 'Y' of cell: 'gf180mcu_osu_sc_12T_mux2_1' because the auto_index algorithm failed to determine the max load using bisection. This can occur when the inside-view algorithm cannot determine a valid vector. Add appropriate 'define_arc' commands specific to pin 'Y' and rerun.
